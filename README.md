Saurabh Thakur
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the process of collecting, working with, and cleaning a data set for analysis.

This project should contain:
tidy data set

CodeBook.md

Readme.md

R script

The script 'run_analysis.R' does the following:
Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.

From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of 
each variable for each activity and each subject.
